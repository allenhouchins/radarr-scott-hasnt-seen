# Scott Hasn't Seen Radarr List

A curated list of movies from the [Scott Hasn't Seen](https://comedybangbang.fandom.com/wiki/Scott_Hasn%27t_Seen) podcast, formatted for easy import into [Radarr](https://radarr.video/).

## What is Scott Hasn't Seen?

Scott Hasn't Seen is a podcast hosted by Scott Aukerman (of Comedy Bang! Bang!) and Sprague the Whisperer, where they discuss culturally significant movies that Scott has just watched for the first time. Each week, Scott determines whether the movie was worth seeing or if he "could have died" without seeing it.

## About This Project

This project automatically scrapes the Scott Hasn't Seen wiki page to extract movie titles, then uses The Movie Database (TMDb) API to get poster URLs and IMDB IDs. The result is a JSON file that can be imported into Radarr to automatically add these movies to your collection.

**Built with Go** for better performance, concurrency, and easy distribution.

## Features

- **High Performance**: Written in Go with concurrent API calls

- **Radarr Compatible**: JSON format ready for Radarr import
