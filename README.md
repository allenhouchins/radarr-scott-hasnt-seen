# Scott Hasn't Seen Radarr List

A curated list of movies from the [Scott Hasn't Seen](https://comedybangbang.fandom.com/wiki/Scott_Hasn%27t_Seen) podcast, formatted for easy import into [Radarr](https://radarr.video/).

## What is Scott Hasn't Seen?

Scott Hasn't Seen is a podcast hosted by Scott Aukerman (of Comedy Bang! Bang!) and Sprague the Whisperer, where they discuss culturally significant movies that Scott has just watched for the first time. Each week, Scott determines whether the movie was worth seeing or if he "could have died" without seeing it.

## About This Project

This project automatically scrapes the Scott Hasn't Seen wiki page to extract movie titles, then uses The Movie Database (TMDb) API to get poster URLs and IMDB IDs. The result is a JSON file that can be imported into Radarr to automatically add these movies to your collection.

**Built with Go** for better performance, concurrency, and easy distribution.

## Features

- **High Performance**: Written in Go with concurrent API calls
- **Automated Updates**: GitHub Action runs daily to check for new episodes
- **TMDb Integration**: Gets accurate movie data, poster URLs, and IMDB IDs
- **Radarr Compatible**: JSON format ready for Radarr import
- **Filtered Content**: Excludes TV shows and non-movie content
- **Rate Limited**: Respectful API usage with built-in delays
- **Single Binary**: Easy to distribute and run

## Automatic Updates

### For Contributors

If you want to contribute or run your own version:

1. Fork this repository
2. Go to your repository's **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**
3. Add the following repository secrets:
   - **Name**: `TMDB_API_KEY`
   - **Value**: Your TMDb API key (get one from [https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api))
   
   **Optional but recommended for automatic updates:**
   - **Name**: `PAT_TOKEN`
   - **Value**: A Personal Access Token with `repo` permissions (create one at [https://github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens))
4. The GitHub Action will automatically run daily at 2 AM UTC

**Note**: If you don't set up a PAT_TOKEN, the workflow will still work for scheduled runs and manual triggers, but may have issues with push-triggered updates due to GitHub's security restrictions.

### Manual Updates

You can also trigger manual updates by:
1. Going to the **Actions** tab in your repository
2. Selecting the "Update Scott Hasn't Seen Radarr List" workflow
3. Clicking **Run workflow**

## Troubleshooting

### GitHub Action Permission Errors

If you see errors like `Permission to [repo] denied to github-actions[bot]`:

1. **For scheduled runs and manual triggers**: This should work automatically with the default `GITHUB_TOKEN`
2. **For push-triggered runs**: You may need to set up a Personal Access Token:
   - Go to [https://github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
   - Create a new token with `repo` permissions
   - Add it as a repository secret named `PAT_TOKEN`

### Missing Movies

If some movies are missing from the list:
- The scraper filters out TV shows and non-movie content
- Some movies might not be found in TMDb's database
- Check the GitHub Action logs for specific error messages

### JSON Import Issues in Radarr

- Ensure the JSON file is accessible via HTTPS URL
- Verify the JSON format is valid
- Check that the IMDB IDs are correct
